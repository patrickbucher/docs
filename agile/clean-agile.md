# Introduction to Agile

The _Agile Manifesto_ originated from the gathering of 17 software experts in
early 2001 as a reaction to heavy-weight processes like _Waterfall_. Since then,
Agile was adopted widely and has been extended in various ways—unfortunately,
not always in the spirit of the original idea.

## History of Agile

The basic idea of Agile—working with small, intermediate goals and measuring the
process—might be as old as civilization. Agile practices might also have been
used in the early days of software development. However, the idea of _Scientific
Management_, which is based on Taylorism, with its top-down approach and heavy
planning, was prevalent in many industries at that time, conflicting with the
_Pre-Agile_ practice then prevalent in software development.

Scientific Management was suitable for projects with a high cost of change, a
well-defined problem definition, and extremely specific goals. Pre-Agile
practices, on the other hand, were a good fit for projects with a low cost of
change, an only partially defined problem, and goals only being informally
specified.

Unfortunately, there was no discussion at that time on which approach was the
better fit for software projects. Instead, the Waterfall model—initially  used
as a straw man to be proven unsuitable by Winston Royce in his 1970 paper
_Managing the Development of Large Software Systems_—was widely adopted in the
industry. And Waterfall, with its emphasize on analysis, planning, and closely
sticking to a plan, was a descendant of Scientific Management, not of Pre-Agile
practices.

Waterfall dominated the industry since the 1970s for almost 30 years. Its
subsequent phases of analysis, design, and implementation looked promising to
developers working in endless "code and fix" cycles, lacking even the discipline
of Pre-Agile.

What looked good on paper—and produced promising looking results in the analysis
and design phases—often terribly failed in the implementation phase. Those
problems, however, have been attributed to bad execution, and the Waterfall
approach itself wasn't criticized. Instead, it became so dominant that new
developments in the software industry like structured or object-oriented
_programming_ were soon followed by the disciplines of structured and
object-oriented _analysis_ and _design_—perfectly fitting the Waterfall mindset.

Some proponents of those ideas, however, started to challenge the Waterfall
model in the mid-1990s, for example Grady Booch with his method of
object-oriented design (OOD), the _Design Pattern_ movement, and the authors of
the _Scrum_ paper. Kent Beck's _Extreme Programming_ (XP) and _Test-Driven
Development_ (TDD) approaches of the late 1990s clearly moved away from
Waterfall towards an Agile approach. Martin Fowler's take on _Refactoring_
emphasizing continuous improvement certainly is a bad fit for Waterfall.

## The Agile Manifesto

17 proponents of various agile ideas—Kent Beck, Robert C. Martin, Ward
Cunningham (XP), Ken Schwaber, Mike Beedle, Jeff Sutherland (Scrum), Andrew
Hunt, David Thomas ("Pragmatic Programmers"), among others—met in Snowbird, Utah
in early 2001 to come up with a manifesto capturing the common essence of all
those lightweight ideas. After two days, broad consensus was reached:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping
> others do it.
>
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan

This _Agile Manifesto_ was published after the gathering on
[agilemanifesto.org](https://agilemanifesto.org/), where it still can be signed,
and and accompanied by [12
Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).
