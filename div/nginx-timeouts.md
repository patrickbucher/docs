- `client_header_timeout`

    - time to complete all the packets of a body
    - connection is closed if body's packages don't all arrive within that timeout
- `send_timeout`
    - the server sends response to the client
    - the response is split up into multiple packets
    - the transmission of all packets must finish within this layout

- `lingering_timeout`
    - when closing a connection:
        - `lingering=off`: connection is closed immediately
        - `lingering=on`: connection is closed after the timeout, so that
