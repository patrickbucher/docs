OpenSSL CLI syntax:

    $ openssl [subcommand] [flags]

The flags use single dashes with long names: `-foo`, not `-f` or `--foo`.

Common flags:

- `-in`: define input (key file or the like)
- `-out`: define output
- `-text`: use textual rather than binary output

The `s_client` subcommand provides a TLS-aware netcat. It can be used to fetch
and output a certificate from a remote website:

    $ openssl s_client -showcerts -connect paedubucher.ch:443 </dev/null | openssl x509 -text -noout

There are two `openssl` commands:

1. Fetching the certificate using `s_client`:
    - `-showcerts`: show the TLS certificate
    - `-connect`: specify a `host:port` to connect to (`paedubucher.ch` on TLS port `443`)
    - `</dev/null`: do not provide any input, which is usually required from `openssl` commands
2. Parsing and displaying the certificate using `x509` (deals with X.509 certificates):
    - `-text`: output human-readable text instead of the binary representation
    - `-noout`: do not output the encoded certificate

Man pages are usually to be found with `openssl-[subcommand]`. Check `apropos openssl`.

The FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) regulates which TLS
algorithms can be used. For organizations operating under FIPS regulation, those
guidelines are mandatory, even though the FIPS lacks a bit behind (e.g. `SHA-1`
is still considered safe).

TLS is used for TCP, DTLS for UDP protocols; they work mostly the same.

RSA (Rivest, Shamir Adelman) and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm) are the most important algorithms for private/public key pairs.

TLS uses public key cryptography to negotiate a temporary, symmetric key that is
actually used to encrypt the data being transferred.

A public key infrastructure (PKI) encompasses the entire system providing
cryptography (e.g. TLS, PGP).
