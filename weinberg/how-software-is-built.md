# How Software Is Built

## New Preface

Three fundamental abilities needed to not lag farther and farther behind
evolving computers:

1. observe and understand the significance of the observed
2. act congruently in difficoult interpersonal situations
3. understand complex situations; plan and modify the plan (the subject of this
   book)

## What Is Quality? Why Is It Important?

Adequate quality to one person may be inadequate quality to another.

> Quality is meeting _some person's_ requirements.

> Every statement about quality is a statement about some person(s).

> Who is the person behind that statement about quality.

Some ideas about software quality:

- zero defects (user)
- lots of features (some users, marketers)
- elegant code (developers)
- high performance (users, sales)
- low development cost (customer, managers)
- rapid development (users, marketers)
- user-friendliness (usersâ€”different kinds of)

> More quality for one person may mean less quality for another.

> Whose opinion of quality is to count when making decisions?

> Quality is value to some person.

Decisions are often hidden from the conscious minds of the persons who make
them. A quality manager must bring those decisions into consciousness.

Internal software organizations have little competition and therefore stagnate.

Improving quality is difficoult (up- or downward spiral):

1. motivation to measure the cost of quality -> 2.
2. understanding the value of quality -> 3.
3. motivation to achieve quality -> 4.
4. understanding of how to achieve quality -> 1.

A lock-on effect, e.g. caused by the choice of a programming language, causes
the cost of change to increase, the motivation and knowledge to change to
decrease over time. A lock-on effect for a programming language entails:

- software tools
- hardware systems (less common nowadays)
- people trained and hired
- specialized consultants
- user community
- managers that grew with it
- books, trainings
- philosophy of software engineering
- user interface philosophy

> People will always choose the familiar over the cofortable.
