# The Go Programming Language

Personal notes on learning the Go programming language.

- `conventions.md`: language conventions, formatted output, UTF-8 encoding
- `examples.md`: self-contained code examples illustrating important concepts
  and the use of the standard library
- `library.md`: excerpts from the Go package documentation containing packages,
  types and functions used so far
- `setup.md`: installation and configuration of the Go environment and
  Vim-based IDE (`vim-go`)
- `structure.md`: how Go code needs to be structured (*additions due*)
- `syntax.md`: the syntax of the Go programming language with examples
- `tooling.md`: usage of the `go` tool
